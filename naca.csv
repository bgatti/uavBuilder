NACA 0012,Symmetric,1000000,1.4,12,0.025,0.0,0.3,3,0.0065,46.2,0.0,"General purpose, good for aerobatics. Zero lift at 0 AoA. Drag increases sharply past cruise AoA."
NACA 2412,Cambered,1000000,1.6,14,0.030,-0.07,0.7,2.5,0.007,100.0,-0.06,"Common general aviation profile, good lift. Lift at 0 AoA (~0.25)."
NACA 23012,Cambered,1000000,1.7,14,0.032,-0.09,0.75,2,0.007,107.1,-0.08,"Similar to 2412, but earlier camber provides slightly higher lift at higher AoA."
NACA 4415,Cambered/Thicker,1000000,1.8,15,0.035,-0.11,0.8,2.5,0.008,100.0,-0.10,"Higher thickness, good for structures or slower flight. More lift at lower speeds."
NACA 64-210,Laminar Flow,1000000,1.2,12,0.020,-0.03,0.4,1.5,0.0045,88.9,-0.02,"Designed for low drag (laminar flow) over a narrow Cl range (the 'bucket'). Sensitive to surface roughness, stall can be abrupt."
NACA 65-012,Laminar Flow,1000000,1.1,10,0.018,-0.02,0.3,1,0.004,75.0,-0.01,"Very low drag at near-zero lift coefficients. Good for high-speed, long-endurance cruise. Stall can be abrupt."
